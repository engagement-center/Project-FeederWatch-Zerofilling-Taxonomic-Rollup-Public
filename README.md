# Working With Project FeederWatch Data

This is a public repository with documentation that enables users working with Project FeederWatch data to perform two key data manipulations that are relevant to most valid uses of the data: zero-filling and taxonomic roll-up.  

We have provided multiple versions of the documentation (R Markdown file, HTML, PDF), and the sample checklist data needed to run the example code in the documentation in this repository. The versions can be accessed from the docs folder, and the link for the html documentation is: [https://engagement-center.github.io/Project-FeederWatch-Zerofilling-Taxonomic-Rollup-Public/](https://engagement-center.github.io/Project-FeederWatch-Zerofilling-Taxonomic-Rollup-Public/)

In this documentation, we reference a “species translation table,” which isn’t needed to run the example code, but is important for determining which species code one needs. This table can be found on the [Project FeederWatch website](https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/).

If you would like to access the most recent version of the complete FeederWatch dataset, it is available on the [Project FeederWatch website](https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/). 

We strongly recommended that anyone interested in using the data consult the [Project FeederWatch data report](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.619682) for tips on proper use of the data.


# Citation

The Project FeederWatch dataset is completely dependent on the efforts of our network of volunteer participants. We ask that all data users give credit to the thousands of participants who have made FeederWatch possible, as well as to Birds Canada and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for developing and managing the program. 

If you use the R code in this documentation, please also give credit to the author, Dr. Wesley Hochachka, who is a Senior Research Associate at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.
